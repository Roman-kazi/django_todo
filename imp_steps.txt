+ TO create a new app

# python3 manage.py startapp app_name

+ After creating new_app add its entry in project_name/setting.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  'app_name'
]

+ after that added the path for the new app in urls.py in project_name/urls
path('newyear/', include("newyear.urls"))

+ now create a new file in app_name/urls.py
and from django.urls import path and
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
 path("", views.index, name='index')
]

+ next go to views.py of that specific app and create functions

+ for html code you can seperate it for each app inside a project

+ to add html files create a directory templates/app_name inside app_name directory
and then inside that create a new html file

++ Note:
+ if you want to use a variable inside html use {{ variable_name }}
+ if you want to use logic inside html use {% logic(conditions etc) %}

+ django has a way of dealing with static files like css
for this create a directory static/app_name in app_name directory

+ to use css
i. create a styles.css inside app_name/static/app_name/styles.css
ii. in the html page at top add {% load static %}
iii. in
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'app_name/styles.css'%}">
</head >
reload the server
