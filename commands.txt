1. django-admin startproject <project name>
2. python manage.py runserver
3. python manage.py startapp <app name>
// a django proejct can have multiple app within it
// after 3 step we need to install the new app into our project
// to do that go to settings.py then INSTALLED_APPS =[
'<app name>'
]
4. View.py // this file contains code for what users will see
Note: often times we will have urls.py for each app in the project
urls.py contains what urls are available to that app

5. Create urls.py in <app name> directory
6. in urls.py there is a variable urlpatterns that contain all the calide route the app can have
7. Now go to projects urls.py and add urlpatterns for the app
include("app_name.urls") tells django to look at app_name urls file for valid urlpatterns for the app

8. You can render html pages return render(request, app_name/html_file_name)
9. the html files will be placed in templates folder inside the app_name directory
django best practice is app_name/templates/app_name/html_file_name
10. render has a third argument known as context here you can pass anything to your html page
(like all the varilables that we want our template to have access to)
